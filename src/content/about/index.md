Hello! I'm Ibrahim, a computer scientist who loves building heavy mathematical things. Previously I developed many **web based applications** and now I deliver solutions in **machine learning**, **vehicle routing problems** and other mathematical scientific things!

I started coding when I was in secondry school and now it's been **more than a decade**. In the last year of secondary school, I took the **first place** in a website development competition organized by [Middle East Technical University](https://metu.edu.tr).

In the third summer of the university, as the sole developer of the Ground Control Station, we took the **9th place** in the [CanSat Competition](http://www.cansatcompetition.com) with my team. I graduated as **third** (*second* in terms of GPA rankings) from [Hacettepe University, Department of Mathematics](http://www.mat.hacettepe.edu.tr/index-en.html) with *3.47 GPA*.

I delivered more than 10 freelance projects and worked & consulted for many companies. I also have many open source projects on the [Github](https://github.com/iedmrc).

Here's a few technologies I've been working with, recently:
